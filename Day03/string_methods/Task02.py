string = " hello world "
position = string . find ("a")
print ( position )

# The method find() on a string aims to find the position of the parameter of the method in the string.
# If the parameter is not found in the string, it returns -1.
# Else, it returns the index (position) and in this exemple it's saved into the variable position and then printed.
